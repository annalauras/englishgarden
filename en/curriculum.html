            <h1>Academics</h1>
            <p>
                The English Garden provides a caring and creative environment designed to make children ready and
                eager to learn. We believe that your child's time with us should be a thoroughly rewarding, enriching
                and happy experience. We will work every day to ensure that each child has the chance to excel. We aim
                to foster every child's potential to the full and provide a sound foundation for their future
                education and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The curriculum is based on the firm belief that children learn best from first-hand experiences – from
                doing rather than from being told. Our curriculum follows the guidelines established by the British
                National Curriculum. For children up to the age of five, we follow the standards set by the Early Years
                Foundation Stage for learning, development and care. For the education of children aged between five
                and seven years, we use the National Curriculum for Key Stage One.
            </p>
            <p>
                Activities are designed to nurture seven areas of learning and development which are all related to
                each other:
                <br />
                Personal, Social and Emotional Development<br />
                Communication and Language<br />
                Physical Development<br />
                Literacy<br />
                Mathematics<br />
                Understanding the World<br />
                Expressive Arts and Design<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                The English Garden Pre-School follows tried and tested British Curriculum resources, including Jolly
                Phonics, Oxford Reading Tree, Maths Makes Sense and Jolly Music. All of these methods provide a solid
                foundation for children’s education through the use of lively and exciting learning materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our aim is to prepare children for their future education and to help them take their first steps
                towards becoming well-rounded individuals. Children in the Baby Daycare have the option to attend
                mornings only or to attend a school day or a full day. In the Pre-school however, because of our
                emphasis on providing a stronger academic curriculum, for children aged three to seven years we only
                offer school day or full day places.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children continuing on to international schools are prepared for entering Year Three of a British
                Curriculum School, whilst Hungarian children enter into Grade One of local schools at the age of six
                or seven.
