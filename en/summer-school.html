                art and crafts, drama and language development. Activities are planned according to age and ability, enabling all
                children to learn in a playful way. For children age 5 and above there is the opportunity to attend Intensive

            </p>
            <p>
                The Summer Programme is divided into five age groups:
            </p>
            <h2>Summer Baby Daycare (0-2 years)</h2>
            <p>
                The Summer Baby Daycare accommodates babies and toddlers by providing playful, happy and fun activities to engage
                each child whilst seeing to their everyday needs in a safe and loving environment. Our dedicated, professional
                staff will work with children in a small group, with a high adult to baby ratio to insure individual learning,
                care and development.
            </p>
            <h2>Summer Nursery School (2-3 years)</h2>
            <p>
                The Summer Nursery School Programme provides a stimulating and challenging range of activities to entertain and
                educate even the youngest of participants. The Summer Nursery Programme is ideal for very young learners, and
                engages children through interactive activities that have been specially designed to appeal to children’s unique
                and individual learning styles.
            </p>
            <h2>Summer School Sparrows (Age 4)</h2>
            <p>
                The Summer School Sparrows group will spend most of their time at the English Garden enjoying art and craft
                activities, learning songs and rhymes, taking part in role play sessions, cooking projects, developing their
                language skills and, of course, having lots of fun and playing lots of games. They will work on both
                individual and small group projects allowing for plenty of supported learning opportunities.
            </p>
            <h2>Summer School Cuckoos (Age 5 – 6), Parrots (Age 6- 7) and Owls (7-10)</h2>
            <p>
                The Cuckoos, Parrots and Owls groups run in parallel to each other. Every week’s theme will incorporate
                activities to stretch their imagination and inspire their creativity alongside exercises to improve essential
                language, mathematical, and motor skills. The highly interactive lessons will concentrate on variety of
                creative pursuits. At the end of each week the children will take home a finished project which will be
                both a souvenir and a reminder of what they have learned throughout the week. With each exciting theme
                the children will encounter a range of new experiences designed to focus their attention whilst building on
                their previous knowledge and skills. All Cuckoos, Parrots and Owls can take part in the weekly trip and the
                weekly swimming option.
