            <h1>Preschool</h1>
            <p>
                The English Garden Pre-School is for children aged 3 to 7 years. It offers the British Curriculum using the
                Early Years Foundation Stage followed by Key Stage One of the National Curriculum. Our aim is to prepare
                children for their future education and to help them take their first steps towards becoming well-rounded
                individuals. Due to our emphasis on providing a stronger academic curriculum we only offer School Day
                (until 3.30 p.m.) and Full Day (until 5.30 p.m.) places.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the English Garden Pre-school we provide a mix of teacher-led and child-directed activities to support
                the intellectual and emotional development of the children; significant learning time is spent in small
                group activities to allow for individual attention. All classes include circle time, language and maths
                classes, art and craft activities, music lessons, drama activities, stories and free play. Science, computers,
                sports (including dance and judo), cooking and cultural celebrations are also included.
            </p>
            <p>
                The children are placed in age-appropriate year groups in accordance with the British Curriculum which is
                based on their age on 1st September. We currently average two classes for each age group:

                Pre-Reception Class: Our kindergarten 1 group is for children aged from three to four years. The ratio is
                one adult for up to eight children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reception Class: Our Kindergarten 2 group is for children aged from four to five years. The ratio is one
                adult for up to nine children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Year 1: This school class is for children aged from five to six years. The ratio is one adult for up to nine
                children.
                <br />Year 2: Our oldest group is for children aged from six to seven years. The ratio is one adult for up
                to ten children.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning of the Pre-reception class the learning is play based but the curriculum slowly shifts
                as the children progress through the year. The children acquire their first notions of numeracy and literacy
                through engaging, playful activities. By the end of the Reception class, most children have acquired basic
                reading and number skills. In the Year One and Year Two classes the focus is on learning good fundamental
                Maths and English language skills as well as exploring Science, Technology, Humanities and Art through
                multi-disciplinary topics and small group project work.
