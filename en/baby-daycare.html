            <h1>Baby Daycare</h1>
            <p>
                At the English Garden Baby Daycare we fully appreciate how difficult it can be to leave your baby or toddler in the care of others. 
                We will ensure that you have all the information you need to make your decision. We aim to be a bridge between home and the Baby Daycare, 
                providing the highest standard of childcare for babies and toddlers from four months up until they are ready to join the Nursery School.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide a friendly, clean, comfortable and safe environment, which both babies and toddlers will find stimulating and challenging. 
                Enjoyment and fun are linked with discovery and learning. Our staff is sensitive and responsive to the individual needs of each child in 
                their care. The adult ratio for babies is 1:3 whilst for toddlers it is 1:4.
            </p>
            <p>
                For babies our professional carers are on hand to give lots of cuddles and conversation. Baby resources include plenty of texture play toys, 
                access to photos of family as well as stimulation from mirrors and play books. There are individual cots for sleeping and comfy places to sit 
                or lie. There are an abundance of specially designed areas where babies can explore, roll around and get to grips with becoming mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                For toddlers our professional carers provide an array of activities to help them learn more about themselves and the world around them. 
                There are many opportunities for exploration, balanced by a routine with regular quiet times. Activities are mainly creative, with plenty of 
                indoor and outdoor physical play, and opportunities for role play and imaginative games.
