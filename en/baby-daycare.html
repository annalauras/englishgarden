            <h1>Baby Daycare</h1>
            <p>
                The English Garden Nursery is a family style daycare facility for children aged from 20 weeks to 3 years of age.
                We offer a bright and spacious home from home environment to inspire and nurture babies and toddlers. The English
                Garden Nursery uses the British Curriculum Early Years Foundation Stage to provide a stimulating and challenging range
                of activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opening in September 2014, the English Garden Nursery was set up to cater for the demand for places for families seeking an
                English speaking kindergarten but whose children are too young to attend the English Garden Pre-School. Our aim to be flexible
                and parents can choose to enroll their baby or toddler from as little as one half day a week to having them stay full time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The English Garden Nursery is located in a building nearby to the English Garden Pre-School. It offers the same excellent level
                of child care in a safe and secure baby and toddler friendly environment. Situated in the historic quarter of Tisztviselo Telep
                ("Garden City"), in the VIIIth District, and just ten minutes drive from the city centre, the nursery occupies a family house
                with a small private garden at the rear. It is surrounded by trees and greenery and is easily accessible by both car and public
                transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide a high quality, British-style childcare to youngsters from the local and expatriate community living in and around Budapest.
                The Nursery is run as a Family Daycare Centre by the English Garden Kft. It is also a member of the Pre School Learning Alliance which
                is the largest organization for providers of early years education in the United Kingdom.
