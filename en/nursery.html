            <h1>English Garden Nursery School</h1>
            <p>
                The English Garden Nursery School serves children from 2.5 years and is considered the Pre-school Preparation
                Class. It is located within the Pre-school in a series of bright and inviting ground floor classrooms. At the
                 Nursery School we aim to provide high quality care and education for children in a secure and stimulating
                 environment. We prepare the children for the next step in their educational journey which is normally the English
                 Garden Pre-School.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the Nursery School we recognise that children learn about the world through active exploration and play. We
                follow the British Early Year Foundation Stage and develop the curriculum to engage and encourage each child's
                 individual potential. We foster both social and academic development through a range of fun and educational
                 activities to establish a foundation for learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nursery School is a in an encouraging and nurturing environment for young children. The classrooms offer many
                opportunities for the children to learn through play based activities. Each week our young learners explore a
                 different weekly theme through stories and pictures, arts and crafts, songs and rhymes as well as sensory play
                  activities. All our activities are planned according to the childrenâ€™s age and ability, enabling all children
                   to learn and develop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our teachers support the children daily in developing cooperation, creativity, and caring for others. The adult
                ratio for the Nursery School is 1:5, typically ten children in a group with two teachers.
